# DistributedMultiStreamBeamforming
This repository contains the Matlab codes for the proposed distributed joint transmit and relay beamforming filter optimization in Section VI. of the following paper:
C. M. Yetis and R. Y. Chang, “Distributed multi-stream beamforming in MIMO multi-relay interference networks,” IEEE Access, vol. 7, pp. 7535 - 7554, Jan. 2019.
The codes can be modified to obtain the proposed distributed transmit beamforming filter optimization in the same paper.
